The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error where a pseudo-element selector is used incorrectly, causing unexpected behavior:

```css
.container::before {
  content: "This is a test";
  display: block;
}

.container::after {
  content: "This is another test";
  display: block;
}
```

This code is intended to add two pseudo-elements before and after the content of `.container`. However, this approach can lead to issues:

* **Unexpected stacking order:** When both `::before` and `::after` are used, the positioning and z-index of the elements might behave differently than expected.
* **Specificity problems:** Overlapping selectors can introduce unwanted styling conflicts, making it challenging to maintain predictable results.
* **Poor maintainability:** It makes the CSS code more difficult to understand and modify in the long run.
